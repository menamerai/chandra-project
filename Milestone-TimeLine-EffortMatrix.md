## Milestone List

1) **Define MVP and Research Tech Stack**: Specify minimum viable product features, research front-end and back-end tech stacks, and investigate prompting techniques and LLM models. This phase sets the technological foundation for the project.

2) **Develop Core LLM Functionality**: Implement LLM prompts for user interaction, fact-checking, and summarization. Research and apply optimal prompt engineering techniques and select suitable LLM models.

3) **Design User Experience and Interface**: Create UX diagrams, UI wireframes, and develop the chat interface with user data input mechanisms. Design necessary visual assets to establish the application's look and feel.

4) **Implement Backend Infrastructure**: Design and set up the database, develop server-side login, and create a conversation storage system. This forms the core backend structure of the application.

5) **Enhance Data Retrieval and Processing**: Develop web data retrieval logic, implement contextual conversation utilization, and design engaging LLM personas to improve response relevance and user engagement.

6) **Create Prototype and Conduct Initial Testing**: Integrate all components, validate core functionalities, and perform initial user testing. This prototype will serve as a proof of concept and gather early feedback.

7) **Optimize System Performance**: Conduct stress and load testing, refine features based on results, and implement scalability optimizations to ensure efficient performance under various conditions.

8) **Enhance User Experience**: Add supplementary features, refine UI/UX based on feedback, and implement additional LLM personas as needed to improve overall user satisfaction.

9) **Launch Beta Version and Gather Data**: Release a beta version to a wider audience, collect user feedback and usage data, and establish ongoing data collection systems for continuous improvement.

10) **Analyze Feedback and Iterate**: Analyze collected data, identify improvement areas and new use cases, implement updates, and plan future iterations to adapt to user needs and expand functionality.
