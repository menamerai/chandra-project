The first constraint to think of is *economic*. We are students, and thus we do not possess significant spare funds that can be realistically used to build a premium product. For our project, we will most likely depend on open-sourced libraries and frameworks to develop. As our project will most likely use Large Language Models (LLMs), which are mostly costly and closed sourced, we will be using weaker open-weight models that can run on our consumer hardware and assume reasonable capability scaling as we allow the end user to use bigger models through API endpoints. However, to align with our desire to publish a free and open-sourced solution, our minimum viable product will only utilize open-sourced frameworks and LLMs that run locally. The second constraint that could impact our product is *ethical* in nature. Despite their capability, LLMs remain a largely unreliable and unsafe product to be pushed freely on the market. This random and unsafe nature run counter to our desire of providing users with a reliable and stable product that helps everyone despite their different use cases. To this, we will try our best to ensure that user engagement with LLMs are guardrailed with safety features and toxicity filters while maintaining agreeable performance on the LLMs.
