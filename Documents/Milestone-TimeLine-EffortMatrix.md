# **Milestone List**

1. **Define Features and Research Technology**: Specify minimum viable product features, identify hardware and software requirements, and confirm the applicability of ROS 2 for all functionalities.

2. **Develop Core Voice Command System**: Implement voice recognition and natural language understanding, focusing on interpreting commands relevant to visually impaired users.

3. **Design Object Detection and Notification System**: Develop computer vision capabilities to detect objects using the camera module and announce detections through the speaker.

4. **Integrate and Test ROS 2 Modules**: Create and test ROS 2 nodes for handling camera input, voice commands, and notification outputs.

5. **Develop Modular Hardware**: Build and validate the attachment hardware, ensuring it is independent of robot-specific sensors beyond cameras and speakers.

6. **Create Prototype and Conduct Initial Testing**: Assemble and test the hardware and software integration in controlled environments.

7. **Evaluate in Real-Life Scenarios**: Conduct field tests, gather feedback, and refine functionality based on performance and usability data.

8. **Optimize and Finalize the System**: Refine software, improve system reliability, and prepare for final presentations and evaluations.
