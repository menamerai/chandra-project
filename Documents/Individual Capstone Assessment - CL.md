My main contribution to this project was ideation, testing, and deployment of an agentic AI workflow that interfaced seamlessly with both our robot control system and backend server. I led the design of our multi-agent reasoning pipeline, which interprets voice-based natural language instructions into structured, executable robot commands. I also implemented robust testing and refinement loops to ensure the system remained generalizable while maintaining control safety and accuracy across diverse command types.

Throughout this project, I applied my knowledge in AI system design, language model prompting, and backend integration. I worked closely with both the server interface and the robotic control logic to ensure consistent behavior and graceful failure handling in real-time interactions.

From my teammate’s perspective, the project posed significant challenges, especially in terms of coordinating development work across vastly different hardware and access limitations. Unlike me, he had limited access to the physical robots and had to simulate or abstract parts of the system during development. He often had to assume the control interfaces I was building already existed so that he could continue working in parallel. In many cases, that meant working with mocked APIs or fabricated command outputs, which introduced extra complexity and occasional delays. In some cases, when integration was impossible to fake, he had to wait on my updates or even take on parts of the robotics development process himself to ensure end-to-end functionality. Despite these obstacles, we both adapted, enabling our system to evolve iteratively and collaboratively.

Together, we developed an end-to-end pipeline capable of interpreting arbitrary spoken commands and executing them through a robotic system using multi-step agentic reasoning. Our final system balanced interpretability, flexibility, and safety—core to building trustworthy robotic agents.
