- As a high school science teacher, I want to customize the LLM persona and difficulty level, so that I can create engaging learning experiences for students with different learning styles and abilities.
- As a self-taught data analyst, I want the LLM to ask me pointed questions when it doesn't understand, so that I can clarify and refine my explanations of statistical concepts.
