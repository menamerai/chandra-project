1. Specify features to construct a minimum viable product (MVP) - Phan Anh
2. Define features for the attachment module, ensuring compatibility across robots - Phan Anh & Cat
3. Brainstorm additional assistive features for visually impaired users (e.g., obstacle notification, navigation aid, path guidance) - Phan Anh & Cat
4. Finalize hardware and software requirements for the module - Cat

## Hardware Development

5. Set up and test the NVIDIA Jetson for development - Phan Anh
6. Design and build a modular hardware attachment for audio and camera modules - Cat
7. Integrate the speaker and microphone hardware into the module - Cat
8. Validate compatibility with ROS 2 for hardware components - Phan Anh

## ROS 2 Integration

9. Create ROS 2 nodes for handling audio input/output, camera processing, and user notifications - Phan Anh & Cat
10. Establish communication protocols between ROS 2 nodes for modular functionality - Phan Anh

## Software Development

### Voice Command System

11. Train or adapt an NLP model for voice-to-text processing and command parsing - Phan Anh
12. Implement a system for configurable voice commands (e.g., adding new commands without reprogramming) - Cat

### Object Detection and Annoucement

13. Implement computer vision algorithms for object detection using the camera module - Cat
14. Develop a voice synthesis system for announcing detected objects - Phan Anh
