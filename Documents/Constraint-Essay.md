The first constraint to think of is *Economic*. We are students, and thus we do not possess significant spare funds that can be realistically used to build a premium product. For our project, we will most likely depend on open-sourced libraries and frameworks to develop. As our project will most likely use Large Language Models (LLMs), which are mostly costly and closed sourced, we will be using weaker open-weight models that can run on our consumer hardware and assume reasonable capability scaling as we allow the end user to use bigger models through API endpoints. However, to align with our desire to publish a free and open-sourced solution, our minimum viable product will only utilize open-sourced frameworks and LLMs that run locally. The second constraint that could impact our product is *Ethical* in nature. Despite their capability, LLMs remain a largely unreliable and unsafe product to be pushed freely on the market. This random and unsafe nature run counter to our desire of providing users with a reliable and stable product that helps everyone despite their different use cases. To this, we will try our best to ensure that user engagement with LLMs are guardrailed with safety features and toxicity filters while maintaining agreeable performance on the LLMs. The third constraint we face is *Social*. Our project is non-profit and community-oriented, prioritizing accessibility for all target audiences. While we're undecided about partnering with a non-profit agency, our goal is to create a product that can help many people at no cost. Our product offers several societal benefits. Primarily, it can enhance people's understanding of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. More importantly, it can improve interpersonal communication by providing LLM-generated suggestions. The final constraint is *Diversity and Cultural*. While aiming for objectivity, we recognize that effective communication varies across cultures. Our challenge is to develop an LLM that avoids cultural bias and adapts to diverse contexts. For example, communication styles in India, Vietnam, and the United States differ significantly. We strive to create a model that understands and respects these cultural nuances, providing relevant suggestions without discrimination. This adaptability is crucial for ensuring our product remains inclusive and beneficial across diverse communities. As we progress, carefully addressing this constraint will be essential to the project's success and ethical implementation.
