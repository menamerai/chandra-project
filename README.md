# The Chandra Project

## Abstract

This project aims to develop a modular attachment for robots to assist visually
impaired individuals by enhancing their ability to navigate and interact with their
surroundings. The attachment will integrate an audio module, a camera module,
and an NVIDIA Jetson to enable the robot to process voice commands, detect
objects in real-time, and provide audible notifications. Designed for universal
compatibility, the module minimizes reliance on proprietary sensors, ensuring
adaptability across various robot platforms. By prioritizing affordability,
accessibility, and open-source development, the project seeks to create a
practical, impactful solution that improves independence and quality of life for
visually impaired users.
