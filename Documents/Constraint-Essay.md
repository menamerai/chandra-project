The first constraint to consider is **Economic**. As students, we have limited financial resources to develop our project, which necessitates cost-effective solutions. Our attachment module will rely heavily on open-source libraries, frameworks, and consumer-grade hardware like the NVIDIA Jetson. While we have access to some sensors and modules, we must optimize their usage to avoid expensive purchases. Additionally, we aim to create a solution that is not only affordable for us but also replicable for others interested in similar applications. This emphasis on affordability aligns with our goal to develop a modular, accessible product that could benefit the visually impaired community without incurring high costs.

The second constraint is **Ethical**. Our project has a direct moral impact, as it is intended to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment safely. Ensuring the system’s reliability and avoiding false positives or missed detections is critical to maintaining user trust and safety. For example, an inaccurate object detection system could lead to dangerous situations. We will prioritize rigorous testing to ensure the robot provides consistent, accurate assistance. Additionally, we will consider user privacy, particularly when processing voice commands or visual data, by designing the system to operate locally whenever possible, minimizing the risk of data misuse.

The third constraint is **Social**. This project is community-oriented, aiming to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals. By enabling robots to perform tasks like obstacle detection and voice command interpretation, we hope to improve users’ independence and quality of life. While we are not currently partnering with a non-profit agency, the project’s open-source nature ensures it can be shared and adapted by others, extending its societal impact. Ultimately, the solution’s ability to serve diverse users without financial barriers underscores its potential as a meaningful public service.

The final constraint is **Diversity and Cultural**. Effective communication varies widely across different cultures and languages, and our system must account for these differences. For example, voice command patterns may differ based on linguistic and cultural norms, and we aim to make the system adaptable to a variety of contexts. Additionally, it is crucial that the robot avoids biases or assumptions that could inadvertently alienate users. By designing the system to be inclusive and adaptable, we hope to ensure it meets the needs of a diverse range of users while respecting cultural nuances.

In addressing these constraints, we aim to create a solution that is affordable, ethical, impactful, and inclusive, fulfilling both the technical and social goals of our senior design project.
